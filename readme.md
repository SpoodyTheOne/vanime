# Vanime Video Streamer
This is a quick project I made in order to get better at Electron.js and Webscraping using Puppeteer and Cheerio

The app works by scraping http://thewatchcartoononline.tv for searches and video urls.
Uses node-fetch for downloading

# Features
Vanime currenly has the following features
 - Searching shows
 - Downloading episodes
 - Downloading episodes in bulk (entire show at a time)
 - Watching shows
 - Queueing episodes (WIP, Currently has no UI)

# Plans
In the future I'm planning on adding a watched list, which keeps track of what episodes you've seen and your timestamp in them.
A to watch list where you can add shows you are planning on watching.
